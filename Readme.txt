**Important note:** This plugin only supports you in fulfilling the guidelines for compliance with the GDPR. Installation is not enough - correct configuration of this plugin by a website administrator is required to achieve conformity. A 100% conformity only through the plugin cannot be guaranteed, as this depends on several other aspects.
